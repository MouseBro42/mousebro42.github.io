    <p>We declare our independence from the hostile and disastrous environment in our current society.<br> They have created a violent, unequal world, a world without much freedom.<br> 
        This utopia must be formed because everyone deserves to be free, and have an optimistic, beneficial environment.<br> People should be permitted to take ownership of the freedom of opinion and expression.<br>
        Our contemporary society has broken our trust by having much violence and disagreements. The creation of a new, perfect society is a must. 
        Our society has some similarities, as well as differences.<br> Our community is still democratic, where people can live free lives and take ownership of their freedom.<br> Our society is different in ways that it provides and expresses freedom and happiness.<br> 
        In our society, people can take possession of freedom, happiness, equality, and positivity in our beneficial environment.
